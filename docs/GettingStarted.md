# Configuration

## Config File
Configurating a CF instance is
locate the `Provider.ts` file under `./config/Provider.ts`
```
- coffee-front (root)
	- config
		- Provider.ts
```

Once you have located `Provider.ts`, follow the rest of the guide to help you fill in the values.

# Building
After configurating coffee, you need to build it.

# Express install

## Bash
If this is the first time you're running CF, use the command `npm run init` to setup the deps and
automatically build the bot.

## Windows
The npm scripts require bash emulation. Use `cygwin` to emulate the bash commands necessary for building the executable code.
